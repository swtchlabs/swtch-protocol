# SWTCH Protocol

SWTCH Protocol is a set of smart contracts which enables management of secrets, networks, tokens, finance, subscriptions and the SWTCH DAO.

SWTCH intends to deploy the SWTCH Protocol to multiple blockchains, starting with Ethereum, then Avalache, Polygon and other EVM chains, then Solana and Cosmos.

The latter deployments will require the SWTCH Protocol smart contracts to be written in a language other than Solidity and will merit its own repository.
