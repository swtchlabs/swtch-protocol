# Payment Channel

Payment Channel is a a basic implementation of a payment channel, which allows a sender to safely and conditionally send funds to a receiver over a specified time period

## Current Features
- Initial Setup: The channel is initialized by the sender, who specifies the receiver and the duration for which the channel will remain open. The channel is funded upon creation.
- Closing the Channel: The receiver can close the channel at any time by providing a valid signature from the sender, which confirms the amount they are allowed to claim.
- Expiration Extension: The sender can extend the expiration date, which provides flexibility in case the agreed conditions change or the intended transactions take longer than expected.
- Timeout Claim: The sender can reclaim the funds if the channel is not closed by the receiver before the expiration.

## Potential Missing Features and Improvements
- Expiration Handling on Close: The contract does not explicitly check for expiration when the receiver attempts to close the channel. This means the receiver could potentially close the channel even after the expiration as long as they have a valid signature.
- Multiple Payments: The current implementation only supports a single payment and closure scenario. In practical use, a payment channel might need to support multiple transactions before being settled.
- Incremental Payments: Linked to the above, the channel could allow partial claims without closing entirely, which would enable the receiver to withdraw funds incrementally as long as the total does not exceed the amount signed for by the sender.
- Dispute Resolution: There is no mechanism for dispute resolution if there is a disagreement about the signatures or claimed amounts, other than the on-chain enforcement of signature validity.
- Event Logging: The contract lacks events for actions like fund deposit, channel closing, and expiration updates. Events are crucial for off-chain applications to monitor the state and respond to changes effectively.
- Security Checks: Consider adding checks or patterns that can prevent potential reentrancy attacks even though the current methods (transfer) used are safe under most conditions. The use of checks-effects-interactions pattern could be enhanced.
- Channel Reusability: Once closed, the channel cannot be reused or re-funded. Adding functionality to reset the channel might be beneficial for long-term relationships between parties.
